## ðŸ’¡ How I Can Help  

If you're an undergraduate student **interested in computational neuroscience, neuroeconomics (decision neuroscience), or machine learning**, feel free to reach out! You can email me with questions about:  

âœ… **Graduate school applications**<sup>1</sup>  
âœ… **Elective course recommendations**  
âœ… **Suggested readings & resources**  
âœ… **Scholarship Applications in Switzerland**  

ðŸ“© **Make sure to include `[advice]` in the subject line** of your email.  

<sup>1</sup> I may not be able to respond immediately to inquiries. Additionally, I do not have the capacity to review graduate school application essays. However, I am happy to share insights about my own graduate school application process and offer strategies to strengthen your application.

## ðŸŽ“ Who Might Find This Most Helpful?  

I particularly encourage students from the following backgrounds to reach out:  

- Northwestern undergraduates
- ETH ZÃ¼rich/UZH MSc students (Especially IDB Students)
- Students from Turkey  

Since I am more familiar with these programs, I might be able to help with questions on **international student life, course selection, and research/post-grad opportunities**.  

Iâ€™m happy to offer insights based on my experiences, whether youâ€™re exploring new fields, preparing for grad school, or looking for research opportunities.
