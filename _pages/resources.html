<h2>📚 Recommended Learning Resources</h2>

<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>decision neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and biologically plausible neural networks/credit assignment</strong>.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be difficult to take courses in all of these domains due to rigid undergraduate and graduate program schedules. Below, you will find a curated list of <strong>book recommendations</strong> categorized by domain, helping you build knowledge in <strong>decision neuroscience, statistics, mathematics, and computer science</strong>.</p>
